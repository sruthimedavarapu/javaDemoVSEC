    <p> java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language, widely used 
        for developing various applications. Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 
        (now owned by Oracle), Java is known for its platform independence,
         meaning code can be written once and run on different operating systems without modification.
         It's a popular choice for creating web applications, Android apps, enterprise software, and more</p>

    <h4> Object-Oriented:</h4>
    <p>Java is based on the principle of object-oriented programming,
         which structures software into reusable modules called objects. </p>
    <h5> Platform-Independent:</h5>
    <p>Java's code is compiled into bytecode,
         which can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on any platform,
          ensuring cross-compatibility. </p>
    <h6> Robust and Secure:</h6>
    <p>Java's design includes features that promote reliable and secure applications, 
        making it suitable for enterprise-level development. </p>
